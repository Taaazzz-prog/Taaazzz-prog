# 👋 Hi, I’m @Taaazzz-prog

- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages for application development, such as:
  - **JavaScript** (for web and server-side development)
  - **Python** (for scripting and data analysis)
  - **Java** (for mobile and enterprise applications)
  - **C#** (for game development and desktop applications)

- 🌱 I’m currently studying at **Numerica, Montbéliard**, to become an application designer.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to application development, whether it's web, mobile, or desktop.
